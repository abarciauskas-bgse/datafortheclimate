      <description>During OceanHackWeek 2020, I was introduced the concept of marine heat waves.
Marine heat waves are massive warming events with extents over 100 kilometers. Climate change has made these warming events more frequent and scientists suspect they are longer and span larger areas. These events impact fisheries, weather and biodiversity.
Yet, research so far has been limited to a temporal scale of 5 days. Chelle Gentemann, oceanographer at Falleron Institute, believes a lot of ecosystems can handle short 5-day heat waves, but the impact of longer heat waves has yet to be studied.</description>
